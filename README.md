# unit-4-game
Star Wars RPG with jQuery

## 1. Game starts once player selects a character and then an opponent based on the health of the character.
## 2. Once player has selected a character and an opponent, the player will click on the crossed lightsabers for the characters to fight.
## Both characters have attack values that decreases the other character's health points shown at the bottom of their image. The only difference is the player's character's damage points increase as the character continues to fight.
## 3. If opponent's health reaches below zero, the player can choose another player to fight. Note: Even though the player's character's health value does not reset, the character's attack points remain the same as last battle and continues incrementing as the next fight goes on.
## 4. The game is over when either the player's character's health reaches below zero or player has defeated all remaining enemies.
